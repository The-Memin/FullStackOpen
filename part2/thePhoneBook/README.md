# Phonebook Frontend

This is the **frontend** of the Phonebook application built with **React** and **Vite** as part of the [FullStackOpen](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course.

The application allows users to manage a contact list: adding, updating, filtering, and deleting phonebook entries. It communicates with a Node.js + Express backend to persist data and fetch updates.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
